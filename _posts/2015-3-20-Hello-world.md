This is my blog, created using _Jekyll Now_ and hosted on _GitHub Pages_.

Let's clear up all this &quot;git&quot; stuff first. Git (_noun, informal_) is an unpleasant or contemptible person. Git is also a distributed version control system. Try not to confuse the two.
 
[GitHub](http://github.com) is a place to store and manage code (and related thingymebobs) in a git repository - or _repo_ for short. Repos can be managed from the command line, on the GitHub website, or using one of the many tools available such as [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com). All this stuff is free.

[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) let's you build and host websites stored in a repo. You can host a website (such as this blog) in GitHub Pages. GitHub is free - I may have mentioned this - and so is GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - a static site generator that is great for blogs. It turns your content into a static website using simple templates. Write content locally, test locally, commit to your repo, and _voila_ - your Github Pages website is auto-magically updated. Static websites are simple; as simple as websites can be.

[Jekyll Now](http://jekyllnow.com) makes light work of creating a basic blog for hosting in GitHub Pages. The code for Jekyll Now is hosted in a git repo, and it's accompanying website is hosted with GitHub Pages. I hope you're following this.

Jekyll content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a simple plain text format that is easy to write and easy for programmable electronic devices to convert into HTML. 

That's quite enough to be getting on with.
