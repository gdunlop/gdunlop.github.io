title: Hello world, revisited
---
It's 5 years since I said [Hello World]({{site.baseurl}}/Hello-world) with my first blog post using the free [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). In the meantime it's become much easier to create a blog like this using  and it still costs nothing so long as you stay within the generous size and usage limits.

## Blog roll
You're allowed one website or blog associated with your GitHub account - like this blog which is hosted at [https://gdunlop.github.io](https://gdunlop.github.io).

But that's not all - you can also publish a website or blog from any repository you create - all at no cost. For example I write other blogs including this one about [Budget Boating](https://gdunlop.github.io/budget-boating).

## Static cling
Blogs often require some sort of *dynamic* website, with articles served up from a database. This makes hosting more involved dynamic sites are more complex.

That's where [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) comes in. This tool generates a *static* website every time you add new content. This means it is just a collection of HTML pages and images - nothing fancy - so it is very easy to host.

However you don't need to worry about hosting as that's all covered Pages. Since Jekyll is now fully integrated into there is hardly any set-up involved, it just works.

## Useful articles
There are many articles covering how to create and host a blog using GitHub Pages.
