title: Hello world, revisited
---
It's more than 5 years since I said [Hello World]({{site.baseurl}}/Hello-world) with my first article.

In the meantime it's become much easier to create a blog like this using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). As they say you just edit, push, and your changes are live.
