title: Hello world, revisited
---
It's 5 years since I said [Hello World]({{site.baseurl}}/Hello-world) with my first blog post.

In the meantime it's become much easier to create a blog like this using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and it still costs nothing so long as you stay within the generous size and usage limits.

With GitHub Pages, you're allowed one website or blog associated with your GitHub account - like this blog which is hosted at [https://gdunlop.github.io](https://gdunlop.github.io).

You can also publish a website or blog from any repository you create. For example, I run a separate blog about [Budget Boating](https://gdunlop.github.io/budget-boating).

## Jekyll and hide
I orginally used a third-party tool called Jekyll to manage blog posts, creating a static website and pushing it to GitHub.

Jekyll is now fully integrated into GitHub Pages and most of the mechanics are hidden from you. There are various templates available but I like the plain and simple *minima* style you are looking at now.
